# Card Payment using React with 3D secure

This sample shows how to build a card form to take a payment using the [Payment Intents API](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-intents), [Stripe Elements](https://stripe.com/payments/elements) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## Features

This sample consists of a `client` in React and a `server` piece available

The client is implemented using `create-react-app` to provide the boilerplate for React. Stripe Elements is integrated using [`react-stripe-js`](https://github.com/stripe/react-stripe-js), which is the official React library provided by Stripe.

The server includes node server (server/README.md) in the [/server](/server) directory. We included several RESTful server implementations, each with the same endpoints and logic.

## How to run locally

To run this sample locally you need to start both a local dev server for the `front-end` and another server for the `back-end`.

You will need a Stripe account with its own set of [API keys](https://stripe.com/docs/development#api-keys).

Follow the steps below to run locally.


**Installing and cloning manually**

If you do not want to use the Stripe CLI, you can manually clone and configure the sample yourself:

```
git clone https://github.com/alexhuszar/react-stripe.git
```

Copy the .env.example file into a file named .env in the folder of the server you want to use. For example:

```
cp .env.example server/node/.env
```

You will need a Stripe account in order to run the demo. Once you set up your account, go to the Stripe [developer dashboard](https://stripe.com/docs/development/quickstart#api-keys) to find your API keys.

```
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<replace-with-your-publishable-key>
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<replace-with-your-secret-key>
```

### Running the API server

1. Go to `/server`
1. Pick the language you are most comfortable in and follow the instructions in the directory on how to run.

### Running the React client

1. Go to `/client`
1. Run `yarn`
1. Run `yarn start` and your default browser should now open with the front-end being served from `http://localhost:3000/`.

### Using the sample app

When running both servers, you are now ready to use the app running in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
